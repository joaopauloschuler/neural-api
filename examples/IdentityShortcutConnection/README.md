# Identity Shortcut Connection
The **identity shortcut connection** is a connection that skips few layers (usually 2 layers) and then is summed with the output of a following 
layer. You can find more about it in the paper [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
and [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-overview-of-resnet-and-its-variants-5281e2f56035).

The main point of attention is the **summation** of outputs. In CAI, this is done via the `TNNetSum` class. `TNNetSum` sums
an array of input layers. For this summation to work, the shape of each input must be the same otherwise you'll
get a run time error. The current example shows this:
```
GlueLayer := NN.AddLayer(TNNetReLU.Create());

NN.AddLayer(TNNetConvolutionReLU.Create({NumFeatures=}64 ,{featureSize=}3, {padding=}1, {stride=}1, {SuppressBias=}0));
NN.AddLayer(TNNetConvolutionLinear.Create({NumFeatures=}64 ,{featureSize=}3, {padding=}1, {stride=}1, {SuppressBias=}0));
NN.AddLayer(TNNetSum.Create([NN.GetLastLayer(), GlueLayer]));
NN.AddLayer(TNNetReLU.Create());
```

This example also detects your OpenCL capable device and falls back to CPU with:
```
EasyOpenCL := TEasyOpenCL.Create();
if EasyOpenCL.GetPlatformCount() > 0 then
begin
  WriteLn('Setting platform to: ', EasyOpenCL.PlatformNames[0]);
  EasyOpenCL.SetCurrentPlatform(EasyOpenCL.PlatformIds[0]);
  if EasyOpenCL.GetDeviceCount() > 0 then
  begin
    EasyOpenCL.SetCurrentDevice(EasyOpenCL.Devices[0]);
    WriteLn('Setting device to: ', EasyOpenCL.DeviceNames[0]);
    NeuralFit.EnableOpenCL(EasyOpenCL.PlatformIds[0], EasyOpenCL.Devices[0]);
  end
  else
  begin
    WriteLn('No OpenCL capable device has been found for platform ',EasyOpenCL.PlatformNames[0]);
    WriteLn('Falling back to CPU.');
  end;
end
else
begin
  WriteLn('No OpenCL platform has been found. Falling back to CPU.');
end;
```
