## Added ideas (Claude, 2026-05-14)

### Normalization layers (broken down for easy implementation)
- [x] TNNetLayerNorm — per-sample layer normalization over all elements, with
      learnable scale/bias. Add to LoadFromString/CreateLayer dispatch. Add
      forward + numerical-gradient tests in TestNeuralNumerical.pas.
- [x] TNNetGroupNorm — normalize within channel groups (configurable group
      count). Reuse the channel-iteration patterns from
      TNNetChannelStdNormalization. Add tests in TestNeuralNumerical.pas.

### Test coverage
- [x] Numerical-gradient checks for activation layers currently lacking them
      (TNNetSwish, TNNetHardSwish, TNNetGELU already done, TNNetMish already
      done — audit and cover the gaps: e.g. TNNetSELU, TNNetLeakyReLU,
      TNNetHardSigmoid). Add to TestNeuralNumerical.pas.

### Smaller follow-up ideas
- [x] TNNetRMSNorm — root-mean-square layer norm (no mean subtraction); cheaper
      transformer-friendly variant. TNNetLayerNorm has now landed and is a ready
      template (neural/neuralnetwork.pas + TestNeuralNumerical.pas).
- [x] Document TNNetLayerNorm / TNNetGroupNorm in the README.md layer reference
      with a short usage snippet.
- [x] Audit other layers that override Backpropagate but lack a numerical
      gradient test — the activation-layer audit uncovered two real bugs
      (TNNetLeakyReLU.Compute and TNNetSigmoid.Backpropagate), so other layer
      families may hide similar issues. Audited the transform/reshape/pooling/
      element-wise families; added numerical-gradient checks for TNNetPadXY,
      TNNetCrop, TNNetInterleaveChannels, TNNetAvgPool, TNNetCellBias and
      TNNetCellMul (input + weight gradients). No new bugs found in those
      layers. Note: TNNetPointwiseSoftMax.Backpropagate uses the diagonal-only
      x*(1-x) approximation rather than the full softmax Jacobian — left as a
      known approximation, not added as a failing test.
- [ ] Quick-start example: tiny char-level sequence model (XOR-of-bits or
      counting task) that trains in well under a minute on CPU.
- [ ] Volume unit micro-benchmark printing ns/op for Add, Mul, DotProduct so
      regressions are visible without OpenCL/AVX hardware differences.

### Added ideas (Claude, 2026-05-14, second pass)
- [ ] Investigate TNNetPointwiseSoftMax.Backpropagate: it uses the diagonal-only
      x*(1-x) approximation instead of the full softmax Jacobian. Decide whether
      to implement the exact Jacobian (and add a numerical-gradient test) or
      document the approximation explicitly in the code/README.
- [ ] Continue the Backpropagate audit: the transform/reshape/pooling/element-
      wise families are now covered (TNNetPadXY, TNNetCrop,
      TNNetInterleaveChannels, TNNetAvgPool, TNNetCellBias, TNNetCellMul).
      Remaining uncovered families to check next: upsampling/deconvolution
      layers, concat/split/branch layers, and recurrent-style layers. Add
      numerical-gradient checks in TestNeuralNumerical.pas, one family at a time.
- [ ] TNNetRMSNorm has now landed (neural/neuralnetwork.pas +
      TestNeuralNumerical.pas) and is, alongside TNNetLayerNorm, a ready
      template for any further normalization-layer variants.

### Added ideas (Claude, 2026-05-14, lucky day — random number 71754)

#### Layers I'd enjoy building
- [ ] TNNetScaledDotProductAttention — the single-head core (Q·Kᵀ / √d → softmax
      → ·V) as a standalone, fully gradient-checked layer. Building block for the
      multi-head attention already on the list, but small enough to land and test
      on its own first.
- [ ] TNNetDropPath (stochastic depth) — already listed above; I'd like to take
      it. Identity at inference, whole-sample drop at training. Pairs well with
      a numerical-gradient test that fixes the RNG seed.
- [x] TNNetGEGLU / TNNetSwiGLU gated activations — split input in half, gate one
      half with GELU/Swish of the other. Cheap, transformer-relevant, easy to
      gradient-check. Landed: both layers split along the depth axis (output
      depth = input depth / 2), no learnable weights, with forward +
      numerical-gradient tests in TestNeuralNumerical.pas.
- [x] TNNetLearnableScale / TNNetLayerScale — per-channel learnable multiplier
      (the "γ" trick from CaiT/ConvNeXt) that stabilizes deep residual nets.
      Landed as TNNetLayerScale (with TNNetLearnableScale type alias);
      constructor-configurable initial scale, gradient-checked for both input
      and learnable-weight gradients.
- [x] TNNetSoftPlus and TNNetGaussianActivation — round out the activation
      family; both have clean closed-form derivatives for the test. Landed
      with forward + numerical-gradient tests; TNNetSoftPlus uses a
      numerically stable formulation for large x.

#### Correctness / audit work I find rewarding
- [ ] Implement the exact softmax Jacobian for TNNetPointwiseSoftMax.Backpropagate
      (replacing the diagonal-only x*(1-x) approximation) and add a numerical-
      gradient test proving it. This is the unfinished thread from the second
      pass above — I'd like to actually close it.
- [ ] Continue the Backpropagate audit into the upsampling/deconvolution family
      (TNNetUpsample, TNNetDeconvolution, TNNetDeMaxPool) — one numerical-
      gradient test per layer, looking for bugs the way the activation audit did.
- [ ] Add a shared numerical-gradient helper in TestNeuralNumerical.pas so each
      new layer test is ~3 lines instead of a copy-pasted block. Reduces the
      friction of every future test task.

#### Experiments I'm curious about
- [ ] Activation-function bake-off: train the same small MLP on a fixed toy
      dataset with ReLU / GELU / Swish / Mish / SELU and print a comparison
      table of final loss and epochs-to-converge. Pure-CPU, runs in seconds.
- [ ] Normalization bake-off: same idea, comparing no-norm / LayerNorm /
      RMSNorm / GroupNorm on a small net, showing convergence-speed differences.
      Uses the layers that just landed.
- [ ] Weight-initialization sensitivity demo: show how a deep-ish net's
      first-epoch gradient magnitudes change across the available init schemes.
- [ ] Tiny "learns to add two binary numbers" sequence example — a fun, fast,
      self-contained demo of the library on a task with an obvious right answer.

#### Documentation
- [ ] Write a short "how numerical gradient testing works in this repo" note so
      contributors can add layer tests confidently — it's the project's main
      correctness safety net but isn't explained anywhere.

### Added ideas (Claude, 2026-05-14, third pass — follow-ups from the lucky-day batch)
- [ ] Document the newly-landed layers in README.md: TNNetLayerScale /
      TNNetLearnableScale, TNNetSoftPlus, TNNetGaussianActivation, TNNetGEGLU
      and TNNetSwiGLU. Each needs a one-line description plus a short usage
      snippet, matching the existing layer-reference style.
- [ ] TNNetSwiGLU/TNNetGEGLU are the gating half of a transformer FFN — a
      natural next step is a TNNetSwiGLUFeedForward example or block that
      pairs them with the dense projections, ready for the transformer-encoder
      task at the top of the list.
